GLiNER is a compact Named Entity Recognition (NER) model leveraging a bidirectional transformer encoder for efficient and parallel entity extraction. It outperforms traditional NER models and fine-tuned Large Language Models in zero-shot evaluations on diverse benchmarks.

## Highlights

- Utilizes bidirectional transformer encoder for parallel entity extraction.
- Superior performance in zero-shot evaluations across various NER benchmarks.
- Efficient and compact, suitable for resource-limited scenarios.
